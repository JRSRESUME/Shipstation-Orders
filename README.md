# Shipstation-Orders
An app to bridge information Between Shipstation and ChannelAdvisor.  See Readme for more Information
Pulls the orders to ship from Shipstation with an image and more information. Shows the remaining quantity in ChannelAdvisor so you can spot check Quantity while Shipping Orders.
Lets you set a bin location for and order cart (we can one with many bins on wheels) so you can do Batch shipping on shipstation.
Check my Shipstation Batch Shipping repository on github for a companion app that works with this one. 
Change all credentials to your own Shipstation and ChannelAdvisor ones.
